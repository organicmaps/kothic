# This file is automatically re-formatted and re-sorted in priorities descending order
# when generate_drules.sh is run. All comments (automatic priorities of e.g. optional captions, drule types visibilities, etc.)

# BG-top geometry: background lines and areas that should be always below foreground ones
# (including e.g. layer=-10 underwater tunnels), but above background areas sorted by size (BG-by-size),
# because ordering by size doesn't always work with e.g. water mapped over a forest,
# so water should be on top of other landcover always, but linear waterways should be hidden beneath it.
# Still, e.g. a layer=-1 BG-top feature will be rendered under a layer=0 BG-by-size feature
# (so areal water tunnels are hidden beneath other landcover area) and a layer=1 landcover areas
# are displayed above layer=0 BG-top.
#
# Priorities ranges' rendering order overview:
# - overlays (icons, captions...)
# - FG: foreground areas and lines
# - BG-top: water (linear and areal)
# - BG-by-size: landcover areas sorted by their size
