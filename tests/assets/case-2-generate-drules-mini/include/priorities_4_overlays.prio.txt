# This file is automatically re-formatted and re-sorted in priorities descending order
# when generate_drules.sh is run. All comments (automatic priorities of e.g. optional captions, drule types visibilities, etc.)
# are generated automatically for information only. Custom formatting and comments are not preserved.
#
# Overlays (icons, captions, path texts and shields) are rendered on top of all the geometry (lines, areas).
# Overlays don't overlap each other, instead the ones with higher priority displace the less important ones.
# Optional captions (which have an icon) are usually displayed only if there are no other overlays in their way
# (technically, max overlays priority value (10000) is subtracted from their priorities automatically).
#
# Priorities ranges' rendering order overview:
# - overlays (icons, captions...)
# - FG: foreground areas and lines
# - BG-top: water (linear and areal)
# - BG-by-size: landcover areas sorted by their size
